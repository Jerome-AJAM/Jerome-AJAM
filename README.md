### Jerome A.J.A. Martina

Hi. I'm a software engineer-in-training at Sheridan College.

Currently, I spend my free time as an active developer on the LOUD Project - a mod for the RTS game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance - under the alias of Rat Circus.  
You can find the account here: https://github.com/TheRatCircus  
And the project itself is here: https://github.com/LOUD-Project/Git-LOUD

I'm not in the job market right now, and I'm also not looking to take on any other projects.  
However, if you have any inquiries, email me at jerome.jaa.martina@gmail.com.
